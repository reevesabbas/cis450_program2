# Setting Up CIS 450 Program 2

Clone Github Repository

Run `npm i`, once completed- run `npm run start`

This will launch the application in your default browser. You will see the screen welcoming you with various inputs.

Input each variable as instructed, `percentages must add up to 100`. And the `Memory Units must be a multiple of 8`, otherwise program will `not allow you to run` the simulation until fixed.

Once all inputs are filled out accurately, hit `Run Simulation`.

It may take a second, but a .txt file should download. This file will contain the simulation inputs, metrics, and run logs. Please examine to see how your inputs affected the simulation.

Happy Testing!
